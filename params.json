Indeed YaCy main website (http://yacy.net) currently only provide following deployment options :\r\n - Windows installer\r\n - Debian package\r\n - Mac Os application\r\n - Cross-platform tar.gz archive with .bat and .sh launch scripts\r\n - Cross-platform sources to compile\r\n\r\nI think some other packaging options could be useful and may help newcomers to try YaCy. \r\n - Self-contained portable application (with embedded jre)\r\n - Cross-platform :\r\n  - Runnable jar\r\n  - Java Web Start link\r\n  - Browser applet\r\n",
